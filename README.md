# LuaLaTeX

Some LuaLaTeX code


**Easy goals**:

1. pass a TeX variable to Lua
2. print a Lua variable to PDF
3. pass a Lua variable to TeX

**Main goals**:

1. format a number in engineering notation with Lua and SIunitX
2. create a kind of `\plot` command, giving the filame of the data file
3. the same but for tables

**Future goals**:

1. create an adaptive LuaLaTeX document (for language, for objects, ...)
2. implement a sort of *Errata Corrige* revisioning system through Lua
3. build on top of adaptiveness in order to make secret environments during printing


**Motivations**  
With the implementation of these high-level commands I'd like to make  
writing a technical report easier.
